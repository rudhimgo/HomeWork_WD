for the Javascript Homework, 

I was trying to create something where you would press the button and it would go through an array and pick a random number. Then ,corresponding to the random number that was chosen, a different location would pop up using the google maps api. Unfortunately, I could not get this to work in the way I wanted, it just keeps using the coordinates I gave for the 4th number in the array, which was Washington Square Park.
